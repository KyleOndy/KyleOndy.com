This is my personal site.
It's based pretty heavily upon both [Jaspervdj's](https://github.com/jaspervdj/jaspervdj) (creater of haykll) and [blaenk's](https://github.com/blaenk/blaenk.github.io)

## ToDo ##
- Customise styling to make it more 'me'.
- add support for 'updated dates'. <https://david.sferruzza.fr/posts/2014-06-18-new-blog-with-hakyll.html>
- automate Resume / CV building
