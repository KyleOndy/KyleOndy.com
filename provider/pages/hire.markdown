I am always open to the opportunity to work with the right people and organization.

## When

I am actively seeking a new opportunity that will challenge me and allow both personal and professional growth.

## Where

I currently reside in the Central NJ / NYC Area.
I would prefer a job not tied to an office, but I am open to work within my geographic area.
At this time I **am not** willing to relocate.

## About Me

Check my [**resume** (PDF Warning)](/static/resume/Kyle.Ondy-Resume.pdf) ([PGP signature](/static/resume/Kyle.Ondy-Resume.pdf.sig)) for a formal overview of my professional experience.

I enjoy enjoying what I do for a living.
I prefer to work in interesting and uncommon areas; hardware, crypto, security, FP, etc.

I loath inefficiencies, particularly easily eliminated inefficiencies.
I find great satisfaction increasing productivity via automation.

## What I am Looking For

* Competitive compensation
* Interesting and technical problem domain
* Friendly team environment.
* Enforced work life balance
* Ongoing education and mentorship

### Culture

I value the following in the culture where I work.

* **Collaboration** — People work together to solve problems. People share knowledge openly and collaborate with people from other roles (e.g. engineering, QA, design, UX, support).
* **Respect** — People respect the people they work with regardless of their role.  People respect users of the software they develop.
* **Work/life balance** — People work about 40 hours a week or less. Working on weekends only happens in extreme situations. Work hours are flexible to accommodate personal life. When people leave work at the end of the day, they disconnect from work. The work environment is sustainable, so burnout is rare.

### Pros

The following things will excite me about your organization.

* Flexible work schedule.
* 20+ days of vacation leave.
* 401k match.
* Donation Matching
* Support for employees using company time for things like professional development, open source contributions, and community outreach.
* Support for employees attending conferences.
* Support for the local tech community.
* Remote work available.

### Cons

The following things will make me less excited about your organization. They're not dealbreakers, but I will probably ask to be paid more if some of these practices are present at your company.

* Pager duty or other on-call requirements. This cuts into work/life balance for me.
* Travel. I don't mind the rare trip somewhere if needed, but regular or even occasional travel doesn't fit my lifestyle.
* An unlimited vacation policy.
* Policies that limit what employees can do with their free time (e.g. banning employees from contributing to open source).

### Dealbreaker

Having a primary role supporting either a printer, a phone, or a 'legacy' system. Life is too short.

## Contact me

Does all of this sound interesting to you? Awesome! You should [contact](/contact) me if you meet all of the following criteria.

* You work for the organization you are contacting me about. Ideally, you are part of or work closely with the technical team.
