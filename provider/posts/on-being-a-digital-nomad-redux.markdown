I like to have control over my services
  freedom on choice
  free
  better control on my information
  price
  curious

Am able to give back to the community from which I take so much

Service I self host (if I've gotten that far, a link to the service)

I have begun a migration from many of the services I currently use to FOSS alternatives I am able to host myself.
The ability to have more control over my data, and to be able to easily move from service to service as needs change is a goal I've wanted for a while.

Services that I used everyday have been discontinued, changed, or demonstrated that they are untrustworthy.

* Google Reader
* Dropbox's multiple security problems, including access without passwords.
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) being purchased by LogMeIn, who have a history of sudden and substantial price increases.

At this point I am taking a proactive rather than a reactive approach and moving away from as many services that I can't control as possible.
A second outcome of this moves means I am able to contribute back to the FOSS community.
