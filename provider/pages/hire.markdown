Kyle needs to enjoy and like day to day tasks.
Kyle like to solve difficult and unconventional problems. Bespoke, uncommon domain, working closely with experts in the domain

# Where

I currently happily reside in the Central NJ / NYC Area.
I would prefer a job not tied to an office, but I am open to work within a reasonable commute of my geographic area.
At this time I **am not** willing to relocate.

# About Me

I loath inefficiencies, particularly easily eliminated inefficiencies.
I find great satisfaction increasing productivity via automation.

# What I am Looking For

* Competitive compensation
* Interesting and technical problem domain
* Friendly team environment
* Enforced work life balance
* Ongoing education and mentorship

## Culture

I value the following in the culture where I work.

* **Collaboration** — People work together to solve problems. People share knowledge openly and collaborate with people from other roles (e.g. engineering, QA, design, UX, support).
* **Respect** — People respect the people they work with regardless of their role.  People respect users of the software they develop. The company respects the roles of the technical team.
* **Work/life balance** — People work about 40 hours a week or less. Working on weekends only happens in extreme situations. Work hours are flexible to accommodate personal life. When people leave work at the end of the day, they disconnect from work. The work environment is sustainable, so burnout is rare.

## Pros

The following things will excite me about your organization.

* Flexible work schedule. 4/10/40, 9/8/80, etc.
* 20+ days of vacation leave.
* 401k match.
* Donation Matching
* Support for employees using company time for things like professional development, open source contributions, 20% time, community outreach.
* Support for employees attending conferences.
* Support for the local tech community.
* Remote work available.

## Cons

The following things will make me less excited about your organization. They're not dealbreakers, but I will probably ask for greater compensation if some of these practices are present at your company.

* Pager duty or other on-call requirements. This cuts into work/life balance for me.
* An unlimited vacation policy.
* Policies that limit what employees can do with their free time (e.g. banning employees from contributing to open source).

## Dealbreaker

Having a *primary* role supporting either a printer, a phone, or a 'legacy' system. Life is too short.
