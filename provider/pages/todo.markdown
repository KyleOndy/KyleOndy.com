Here are the things I'd like to get done on this site.

## Literate Haskell

- site.lhs -> move into provider and make it a post

## Content

- add CV / resume
- add focus on FP to hire me page.
- keybase stuff
- seo (google / ddg) results

## Styling and Structure

- hakyll-sass -> comment on PR -> fork -> upload to hackage / stackage -> PR to include in lts
- remove '/index.html' from all the links
- write fresh sass
- tags
- modification date from git?
- 404 page
- make different header levels stand out
- images are not responsive (CirclCI)

## Infra

- s3 hosting / s3_website
- logging?
- feed.xml vs atom.xml

## New Features / Ideas

- code graph - https://github.com/meoblast001/meosite/tree/master/code-graph. (could add to opensource page)
- Add aside to top of notes index, explaining they are random notes of mine for easy reference (or on top of each note?)
- qutebrowser -> :config-write-py -> add to dots
- Add Edit / PR link to all pages

## General
- start writing ~2 posts a month

## Page Specific
